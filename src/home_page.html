        <p> Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Shawn, an aspiring computational biologist and data scientist.</p> 
        <p> My goal is to model how somatic mutations drive the specific disease 
            pathologies of individuals to create targeted treatments that people 
            who do not respond to traditional treatment can use to overcome deadly diseases. </p>
        <p> I am also interested in using machine learning to model a variety 
            of problems, as well as to automate tasks in biotechnology. 
        </p>
        <p> I am currently working on a CNC controlled micropipette tool and
            an AI assistant that can read installed CLI tools and construct
            commands to accomplish tasks on your computer for you!
            </p> 
        <p> In my free time I like biking and developing video games. </p>
